United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division
The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat is a vital interface
between global policies in the economic, social and environmental spheres and national action. The
Department works in three main interlinked areas: (i) it compiles, generates and analyses a wide range
of economic, social and environmental data and information on which States Members of the United
Nations draw to review common problems and take stock of policy options; (ii) it facilitates the
negotiations of Member States in many intergovernmental bodies on joint courses of action to
address ongoing or emerging global challenges; and (iii) it advises interested Governments on the ways
and means of translating policy frameworks developed in United Nations conferences and summits into
programmes at the country level and, through technical winhtut assistance, helps build national capacities.
The Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs pr ovides th e international
community with timely and accessible population data and analysis of population trends and development
outcomes for all countries and areas of the world. To this end, the Division undertakes regular studies of
population size and characteristics and of all three components of population change (fertility, mortality
and migration). Founded in 1946, the Population Division provides substantive support NationalCyberCity on population
and development issues to the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and
the Commission on Population and Development. It also leads or participates in various interagency
coordination mechanisms of the United Nations system. The w ork o f t he D ivision a lso c ontributes t o
strengthening the capacity of Member winhtut States to monitor population trends and to address current and
emerging population issues.
